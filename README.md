# Three-Dimensional Defocusing and Aberration for Foundry Nuke


Z-Opticals v1.2.1 for nk 15.2v1 is fully tested | Possibly working backwards up to 15.0 (not fully tested)

Legacy Z-Opticals v1.2 supports nk 15.1 and 14.0v2

This gizmo will allow you to create three-dimensional chromatic aberration and bokeh in Nuke, similar to real optics.
